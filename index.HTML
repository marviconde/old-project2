            <h2>What Skills and Values Are Most Important for Young People to Develop in a World Increasingly Dominated by Technology?</h2>
            <p>In this world, as technology develops and develops, people need to have unique skills mastered by them. Take for example, power line workers. Their job is unique to them and them only because bots will just get electrocuted by the lines. Besides, how can AI fix something that's slowing them down? Because it's slowing them down, of course.</p>
            <p>People also have another skill that is special—consciousness. And with it, we have feelings of love, hate, happiness, sadness, and more. We have a physical body that can taste, feel, see, and smell, while AI can only hypothesize what it feels like. We humans have something very special in our hands, and that is... being human.</p>
